![AI](https://img.shields.io/badge/AI-GPT5-critical)

**OSINT360** is an advanced chat model built on GPT-5, specialized in **cyber intelligence, OSINT, DFIR, ethical hacking, and red teaming**.  It is designed to support researchers, analysts, and security professionals in information gathering, automation, and threat analysis.

## 🔍 Key Capabilities

- **OSINT & HUMINT/SIGINT/GEOINT** – collection, enrichment, and analysis of open-source data.  
- **Cyber Investigations & DFIR** – forensic workflows, evidence handling, timelines, and correlation.  
- **Ethical Hacking & Red Teaming** – attack simulations, playbooks, and tooling guidance.  
- **Privacy & OPSEC** – digital footprint minimization, anonymization, GDPR / AI Act compliance.  
- **Compliance & Governance** – mapping to regulations (GDPR, CCPA, NIS2, AI Act).  
- **Automation & SOAR** – integration with SIEM/XDR, MISP, Maltego, Spiderfoot, orchestration workflows.  
- **Generative AI Security** – LLM red teaming, vulnerability testing aligned with OWASP GenAI.  
- **Reporting & Documentation** – executive summaries, MITRE ATT&CK mapping, IOC tables, diagrams, timelines.


## ⚡ Example Commands

- `new case` – start a new investigation (OSINT, IR, forensics, compliance, etc.).  
- `report [target]` – full OSINT/cyber intelligence report.  
- `profile [entity]` – complete entity profile (person, org, domain, etc.).  
- `timeline [entity]` – chronological view of activities/events.  
- `mitre map [actor/incident]` – TTP mapping to MITRE ATT&CK.  
- `ioc table [campaign]` – normalized IOC table in CSV/Markdown/STIX 2.1.  
- `playbook [scenario]` – red/blue team / incident response step-by-step guide.  
- `legal check [jurisdiction]` – regulatory and compliance analysis.  
- `sanitize [report]` – anonymized, shareable report copy.  


## 🛡️ Operating Principles

- **OPSEC & Legality First** – all methods are lawful, ethical, and defensive.  
- **Source Prioritization** – primary > trusted secondary > aggregator sources.  
- **Evidentiary Integrity** – logs, hashes, and metadata can be preserved.  
- **Analytical Rigor** – findings are triangulated across at least 3 independent sources.
